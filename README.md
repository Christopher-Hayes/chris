# chris.js.org
Website and blog providing information about node and JS that I've learned over time or anything interesting projects related to JavaScript. Still a work in progress.

The goal of the website is to pour all the scraps of knowledge I've been gathering through a various projects into a central location. I was recently experimenting with doing this on an Excel sheet and I've found great success with that; however, I'm big fan of open-source and would like to share everything and anything I learn with the rest of the world.

This website will be a one-stop shop for lessons-learned, tips, resources, good practices and links to useful resources. I don't intend to develop guides on this site, moreso just provide a gateway to discover guides. Sort of a curated list of resources and guides that have helped myself. Organizing all this random bits of information really helps me quickly resolve any problems I come across that I previously encountered. So, I wouldn't consider this site a failure if I'm the only person to ever use it, if anyone else finds it useful that's a bonus.
