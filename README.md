# chris.js.org
Website and blog providing information about node and JS that I've learned over time or anything interesting projects related to JavaScript. Still a work in progress.

The goal of the website is to poor all the scraps of knowledge I've been developing for a various projects into a central location. I've been experimenting with doing this on an Excel sheet and I've found good success with that; however, I'm big fan of open-source and would like to share everything and anything I learn with the world. This website will be a one-stop shop for lessons-learned, tips, resources, good practices and links to useful resources. I don't intend to develop guides on this site, moreso just provide a gateway to discover guides. Sort of a curated list of resources and guides that have helped myself.

**Tech:**

Bootstrap, SASS, Handlebars

**TODO:**
- [x] Scrap experimenting with Foundation and just do Bootstrap
- [ ] Projects page and Toolbox page.
- [ ] Setup a CMS API for the blog, probably KeystoneJS, implement frontend with Handlebars.
- [ ] Continue making blog posts.
- [ ] Resources page maybe?

**Goals:**
- [ ] Make a blog post every day this week. (7/29-8/4)
- [ ] Finish the other pages including the CMS backend
- [ ] 25 Blog posts
